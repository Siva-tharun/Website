    <p id="p1"><b>"Die with a Smile"</b> is a song by American singer-songwriters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga" title="Lady Gaga" target="_blank"><del><b>Lady Gaga</b></del></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Mars" target="_blank" title="Bruna Mars"><del><b>Bruno Mars</b></del></a>. It was released on August 16, 2024, through Interscope Records. Initially intended to be a standalone single, the song was later announced to be included on Gaga's upcoming eighth studio album, Mayhem (2025). Gaga and Mars wrote and produced the track alongside Dernst "D'Mile" Emile II and Andrew Watt while James Fauntleroy provided additional songwriting.</p>
    <p id="p2">The collaboration was a result of Mars inviting Gaga to his studio where he had been working on new music. He presented the track in progress to her and the duo finished writing and recording the song the same day. In the song, Gaga and Mars express a powerful longing to be with a loved one, highlighting the urgency and depth of their love in the face of uncertainty and potential endings.</p>
    <p id="p3">Musically, the soft rock-leaning track has been compared to Gaga's 2016 album Joanne and her 2018 release, "Shallow" from the A Star Is Born soundtrack, and Mars' work with Anderson .Paak as part of the Silk Sonic project. An accompanying music video directed by Mars and Daniel Ramos showing both singers performing the song on a retro stage set was released simultaneously alongside the track.</p> 
    <p id="p4">Music critics lauded both singers' vocals and chemistry. The song was a commercial success, topping the Billboard Global 200 chart for eight weeks, making it one of the chart's longest-reigning weekly hits for 2024 and one of the longest-reigning daily hits in Spotify history. By the start of 2025, it had topped the official charts in more than 20 countries, and peaked at the top ten elsewhere. "Die with a Smile" was nominated for Song of the Year and won for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards.</p>

    <h1>Development</h1>
    <p id="p5">Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars first performed and sang together at the 2016 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show on November 30, 2016, as a part of the lineup.[1] In June 2024, Mars mentioned he would like to collaborate with Gaga on a song or "sing with her on her Las Vegas residency".[2] In a press release, Gaga revealed: "Bruno and I have a lot of mutual respect for each other and were talking about collaborating".[3] She revealed that the collaboration materialized while she was recording her upcoming studio album in Malibu. One night, after a long day, Mars invited Gaga to his studio to listen to music he had been working on and presented the track to her. At this point, she was "blown away" when she heard what he was working on.[4]</p>
    <p id="p6">The duo finished writing and recording the song on the same night. Gaga described Mars' talent as"beyond explanation" and "next level", while Mars added that Gaga made the song "magical".[5]
    On August 12, Mars and Gaga started following each other on Instagram.[6] On the same day, Gaga posted a series of emojis on Mars' Instagram post from his tour stop in Mexico City. On August 13, Gaga shared a video of herself playing a few chords of the song on a piano. During the video, she wore a shirt with Mars' face.[7] The following day, Mars posted a photo wearing a T-shirt with Gaga's face on it.[8]</p>

    <h1>Release</h1>
    <p id="p7">Previously, a post from Hits magazine's "Rumor Mill", announced a collaboration between Gaga and Mars, revealing the song's title.[7] "Die with a Smile" was officially announced days later on August 15.[9] The accompanying artwork shows the artists dressed in "country-leaning" red-and-blue "Western" outfits with Gaga smoking a cigarette and Mars wearing a cowboy hat.[10] Representatives for Gaga initially claimed the song would be a standalone single—a claim reiterated by Gaga herself.[9] However, it was later announced that the song would be on her eighth studio album, with Gaga calling it a "huge part" of the album and its "missing piece."[11]</p>

    <h1>Composition</h1>
    <p id="p8">"Die with a Smile" featured writing and producing credit from Gaga, Mars, Dernst "D'Mile" Emile II, and Andrew Watt, with additional writing on the track by James Fauntleroy.[12] The song was written and recorded at Gaga's studio in Los Angeles in 2024.[13] It has been labeled as a soft rock song,[14] displaying the emotional style of a pop and soul ballad.[15][16] Billboard's Kyle Denis described the song as a soaring ballad that blends pop, soul, country, and rock.[17] It has been compared to Silk Sonic, Mars' collaboration project with Anderson .Paak.[16] Critics found the sound to be closer to that of 1970s soft rock.[14][18]</p>

    <p id="p9">Regarding the writing and recording process, Gaga explained that one night she was working on her next album at a studio in Malibu when she received a call from Mars, who invited her to another studio nearby to listen to a song he had been working on.[19][20] She said: "I went to see him at around 10 p.m. He showed me the idea, and then we wrote the second verse. We recorded it by 2 a.m. Bruno had a very specific way he wanted it to sound, and I wanted to give him that."[21] She also mentioned that they aimed for the harmonies to feel "very 1970s" and were inspired by the collaborations between Carole King and James Taylor during the creative process.[22] In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, she stated:

    I remember feeling that it was a song people needed to hear. I write music all the time, and sometimes you feel like you're creating something that some people might like. But there are other times when you work on something, and you just know it's going to speak deeply to all kinds of people. I knew it immediately.[23]</p>

    <h1>Critical reception</h1>
    <p id="p10">"Die with a Smile" received critical acclaim.[24] Robin Murray of Clash magazine gave the song eight out of ten stars, describing it as "a homage to those lush 70s duets" that "also feels profoundly modern". He added that "both artists shine, but there's an undoubted chemistry here that lets 'Die With A Smile' have a character of its own". Murray noted that "there's a feeling of mutual respect on this latest single, with both artists serving to push each other to different spaces", and said that "it's camp in places, but that's simple exuberant fun and hyped-up colour – the essential songwriting remains intact, plucking at those heartstrings". He concluded that the collaboration is "an unexpected triumph, one that leans on the strengths of both artists, before presenting something new".</p>
    <p id="p11">Jake Viswanath of Bustle wrote that the song "blends Gaga's emotive pop melodies with Mars' old-school R&B influences", with addictional "twang-y instrumentation", into a "sweepingly romantic and devastating" song which "portrays two lovers who want to experience their last moments with each other".[18] Joey Nolfi of Entertainment Weekly defined the song as a "spiritual sequel" to Gaga's 2018 single "Shallow".[15] Writing for Music Talkers, Peter Källman called the collaboration "a soulful masterpiece".[26] Consequence gave a generally positive review: "both artists sound great — Gaga's vocal run as she starts her verse is perfect! — and, as Paolo noted, the production from Andrew Watt is solid as ever. And at the end of the day, new, perfectly fine music from Lady Gaga is better than no new music from Gaga at all."[27] Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone noted "the new track puts the duo's soaring vocals on full display".[28] Paul Grein from Billboard called the song a "match made in Grammy heaven" and an "instant smash".[29] The New York Times dubbed the song "a romantic, lightly apocalyptic slow-dance that offers both the opportunity to belt to the rafters."[30]</p>
